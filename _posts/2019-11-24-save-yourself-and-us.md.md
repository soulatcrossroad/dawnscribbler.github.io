<p C: Who is the King of glory?<br>
K: You, Christ, you are the King of glory. But...not on the cross. There, you look rather unfortunate. <br>
C: I'm not coming down from here. This is the will of my Father. <br>
K: Well, fine. You stay there looking pathetic. I'm going to stay here looking glamorous. Someone has to look good for the camera.

<p style="text-align: justify;">When Jesus performed miracles, He was recognizable as the Son of David. When He cast out demons, He was recognized as the Holy One of God. When He preached, He was recognized as the Son of Man. When He rode on the donkey, He was recognised as King of Israel. But when He hung on the Cross, the only deduction that could be made was that He was unfortunate.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The necessity for Jesus to die, and to die horribly, is not easily swallowed. I can say I understand, but my actions, desires and aspirations tell a different story. There is no amount of words that can whitewash the horrors of a cruel death unless I block my mind to its reality. It is uncomfortable to watch someone dying and not be able to do anything about it. It is worse to watch someone dying knowing that the same thing is going to happen to me. It is not natural for someone to be willing to suffer and die when there are remedies everywhere. There is nobody that will see death coming who will not try to prevent it. It is difficult to remain calm and resigned especially when one is innocent; not to let loose some emotion – rage, indignation, protests of innocence – or to struggle and beg to be released.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I read a meditation once that said, "Jesus did not come down from the Cross." And I scoffed at the meditation; I didn’t see anything significant about that point. But when I think about it, I see that the dilemma is not always about whether or not I have faith, but about my motive for embracing the faith. What do I hope to gain by confessing Christ as King? Is it about what I want from Him? Or is it about what He has for me? The rulers were willing to accept Him as the Christ of God, the Chosen One, <i>if</i> He conformed Himself to their ways. The thief would have been happy to acclaim Him as Christ <i>if</i> Jesus would save him from his present predicament, and only for as long as it would take to save him. But Jesus did not come down from the Cross; He stayed there and died. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Sometimes, we ask for God to come, but we don’t see Him because we have an idea of what He should look like, how He should act and what He should do. We ask for God’s intervention, but we don’t recognise it because it’s not what we had in mind. Before we acclaim Christ as our King, we should be clear on which group we belong to: the ones who smothered their conscience justifying that they were right in killing an imposter who claimed to be the Christ of God because He didn't conform, or the one who is only concerned about earthly things and wants to escape the consequence of his action by paying eye- and lip- service until it is accomplished or the one who fears God to accept the just sentence for his crimes and fixes his eye on a place in the eternal kingdom.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If we acclaim Christ as our King, that means we accept Jesus as our model of living and everything we do must conform to the will of God. It means that our eyes are fixed on our heavenly reward; the reward ceases to be a concept or an idea, but something very real. Fixing our eyes on heaven doesn’t remove us from our present existence or excuse us from our responsibilities, but it ensures that we do not consider them our end and fix all our attention on them to the exclusion of God. Fixing our eyes on heaven enhances and perfects our lifes on earth such that when it is over, we transition very naturally to the next life. God ceases to be just a fixer of problems, an object we take out to admire and exclaim over once in a while or a riddle we try to solve in order to pass time but a teacher and companion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Jesus did not come down from the Cross; He stayed there and died. And then, He arose and received His glory; He received a name which is above all other names; a name at which every knee must bow in heaven, on earth, and under the earth to the glory of God. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">T: Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingly power<br>
J: Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.
